## Instructios
- Pressing the arrow keys will move all the tiles in the direction of the key pressed. After all the tiles are done moving, a new tile with the value of 2 or 4 will be created in a random available space on the board.
- Merging of tiles happens when two tiles with the same number collide which will create a single tile of the combined values
- The game is over when there are no valid movements of the tiles
- Points will increment based on the combined tiles value

## Goal 
Combine tiles of the same number in an attempt to create a tile with the value of 2048.
